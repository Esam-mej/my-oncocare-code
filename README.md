ide like to get these improvments to my code

Key Areas for Improvement:

1. **Error Handling & Robustness**:
   - Add more comprehensive error handling throughout the application
   - Implement transaction-like behavior for critical operations (patient saves, deletes)
   - Add input validation beyond just mandatory field checks

2. **Performance**:
   - Implement lazy loading for large datasets (especially in view_all_patients)
   - Add pagination for patient lists
   - Optimize Google Drive/Firebase sync operations

3. **Security**:
   - Implement session timeouts
   - Add audit logging for sensitive operations
   - Encrypt sensitive patient data at rest
   - Implement proper role-based access control checks throughout
4. **UI/UX**:
   - Implement a proper loading indicator during long operations
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - Improve form navigation (tab order, field focus)
   - Add form validation feedback as-you-type

5. **Technical Improvements**:
   - Implement proper dependency injection
   - Add unit/integration tests
   - Separate concerns better (move business logic out of UI)
   - Implement proper data access layer

5. **Add and edit**:
> I want drop lists to be coded to be editable by mej.esam can add and delete values 
>Add a button in home screen named F&N documentation, its function when clicked is to request from the user to enter the path on the users computer of an applications exe file to run , and that bath is saved and can not be edited by any user except mej.esam
>Add a setting button in the home screen viewed only to mej.esam , no any other user can access it , its function is to make edits to a lot of software functions like drop lists to add and delete and edit its input values , change the bath of app that gets runed by clicking F&N documentation button , delete all local patients records folders and files

>Clinical Workflow improvments
        - Add treatment timeline visualization
       - Implement proper patient status tracking
       - Add medication management with dosage calculations ,bsa calculator,what medications he recived   and what he is currently on
Here's how to implement medication management with BSA calculation and dosage features in my oncology application:
1. BSA Calculator Integration
Where to Add:
•	Add a "Calculate BSA" button in:
o	Patient overview screen
o	Medication management screen
o	Chemotherapy protocol screens
How it Works:
1.	Input Fields:
o	Height (cm)
o	Weight (kg)
o	Formula selection (Mosteller/DuBois/Haycock)
2.	Calculation:
o	Mosteller formula: √(height × weight / 3600)
o	DuBois formula: 0.007184 × height^0.725 × weight^0.425
o	Haycock formula: 0.024265 × height^0.3964 × weight^0.5378
3.	Features:
o	Save BSA to patient record
o	Auto-fill in medication dosage calculations
o	Display historical BSA trends
2. Medication Management System
Where to Add:
•	Dedicated tab in patient record
•	Quick access from chemotherapy protocols
Key Components:
1.	Current Medications:
o	List of active medications
o	Dosage, frequency, route, start date
o	Discontinue button
2.	Medication History:
o	Complete treatment history
o	Filter by date/type
o	Reinstate previous medications
3.	Add New Medication:
o	Searchable medication database
o	Auto-calculated doses based on BSA
o	Protocol-specific default values
3. Dosage Calculation System
Implementation:
1.	Protocol-Based Calculations:
o	Store standard protocols with medication parameters
o	Calculate doses using: Dose = BSA × Protocol Dose/m²
2.	Custom Calculations:
o	Manual override option
o	Round to nearest vial size
o	Adjust for renal/hepatic function
3.	Safety Checks:
o	Maximum dose warnings
o	Cumulative dose tracking
o	Drug interaction alerts
4. Medication Tracking
Features:
1.	Current Medications:
o	Visual indicators for critical meds
o	Next due date tracking
o	Administration history
2.	Historical View:
o	Timeline visualization
o	Response/efficacy markers
o	Toxicity documentation
3.	Reporting:
o	Medication summary for handoffs
o	Protocol compliance reports
o	Cumulative dose reports
5. Workflow Integration
Clinical Use Cases:
1.	New Chemotherapy:
o	Select protocol → auto-populate medications
o	Calculate doses → provider verification
o	Generate administration instructions
2.	Dose Adjustments:
o	Modify based on toxicity
o	Track changes over time
o	Document rationale
3.	Transition Points:
o	Induction → Consolidation
o	Outpatient → Inpatient
o	Treatment phases
4.	- lab investigations that needs documentation: wbc count , hb , plt , hct , neutro count , lympho count , urea , creatinine. na , k , cl , ca , mg ,ph , uric acid ,ldf , ferritin, pt aptt , inr, viral screen , fibrinogen, d.diamer ,gpt , got , alk ph, t.b ,d.b , ABG , and others
        -also documentation of echocardiogram EF

Comprehensive Lab Investigations System for Pediatric Oncology
1. Core Components to Track
Track these critical lab categories with pediatric-specific reference ranges:
•	Blood Counts: WBC, Hemoglobin, Platelets, Neutrophils (ANC), Lymphocytes
•	Kidney Function: Urea, Creatinine, Electrolytes (Na/K/Cl), Calcium, Magnesium
•	Liver Function: AST, ALT, Bilirubin (Total/Direct), ALP
•	Coagulation: PT, APTT, INR, Fibrinogen, D-Dimer
•	Special Tests: LDH (tumor burden), Ferritin (iron overload), Blood Gases, Viral PCRs
•	Cardiac: Echocardiogram EF% (for anthracycline monitoring)
2. Key Features to Implement
A. Smart Lab Entry
•	Auto-complete test names with common pediatric oncology panels (e.g., "Pre-Chemo Labs")
•	Age-adjusted normal ranges (a 2-year-old's normal Hb differs from a teen's)
•	Visual flags for abnormal values (🟡 Mild, 🟠 Moderate, 🔴 Critical)
•	Protocol context (e.g., "Day 8 of Delayed Intensification")
B. Trend Visualization
•	Sparkline graphs showing:
o	Blood count recovery after chemotherapy
o	Kidney/liver trends during nephrotoxic/hepatotoxic drugs
o	Tumor markers (e.g., LDH for lymphoma)
•	Nadir tracking: Auto-detect and flag lowest blood counts post-chemo
C. Toxicity Monitoring
•	CTCAE Grading (standard oncology toxicity scale):
o	Example: Grade 4 Neutropenia = ANC <500 cells/μL
•	Protocol-specific alerts:
o	"Hold methotrexate if Cr >1.5× baseline"
o	"Febrile neutropenia risk: ANC <1000 with fever"
D. Treatment Decision Support
•	Chemotherapy clearance checklists:
o	"ANC >750? According to protocol guidelines ✓, Platelets >75k? According to protocol guidelines ✓, Bilirubin <2.0? ✗ → Delay"
•	Transfusion triggers:
o	"Hb <8.5 g/dL → Consider PRBC transfusion"
o	"Platelets <20k → Prophylactic transfusion"
3. Workflow Integration
For Clinicians:
1.	Pre-Chemo Workflow:
o	System displays required labs (e.g., creatinine before cisplatin)
o	Flags unresolved critical values before approving chemo
2.	During Treatment:
o	Tracks expected nadirs (e.g., "Platelets will likely drop Day 7-14")
o	Alerts if labs are overdue
3.	Long-Term Monitoring:
o	Tracks cumulative doses (e.g., "Doxorubicin: 250/300 mg/m² max")
o	Schedules survivorship labs (e.g., annual echocardiograms)
For Nurses/Parents:
•	Simplified views with color-coded results
•	Explanatory notes: "Low neutrophils → infection risk"
•	Home monitoring guides: "When to call for fever"
4. Pediatric-Specific Considerations
•	Age-based norms: Newborn vs. adolescent lab values
•	Growth tracking: Plots labs alongside height/weight percentiles
•	Family-friendly reports: Minimal jargon, visual trends
5. Safety & Compliance
•	Hard stops for life-threatening values (K⁺ >6.5 mEq/L)
•	Audit trails: Who entered/verified each result
•	Protocol adherence reports: "% of required labs completed"
6. Advanced Features (Optional)
•	LIS Integration: Auto-import results from hospital lab systems
•	Predictive analytics: "Expected ANC recovery in 2 days"
•	Mobile alerts: Push notifications for critical values

       - Include lab result tracking and trending
       
      -next appointments and next protocols schedule
