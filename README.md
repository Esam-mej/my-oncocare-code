## Requested Changes

First of all I want u to **Add and edit**: > I want drop lists to be coded to be editable by mej.esam can add and delete values >add a calculators button  >Add a button in home screen named F&N documentation, its function when clicked is to request from the user to enter the path on the users computer of an applications exe file to run , and that bath is saved and can not be edited by any user except mej.esam >Add a button in the home screen viewed only to mej.esam to configure system settings, no any other user can access it , its function is to make edits to a lot of software functions like drop lists to add and delete and edit its input values , change the bath of app that gets runed by clicking F&N documentation button , delete all local patients records folders and files



1.	Security & User Privileges System Current Issues:
Privilege checks are inconsistent
No proper audit logging
Password security can be improved
Improvements Needed:
A. Enhanced User Roles & Privileges
>Super Admin (mej.esam) Exclusive Privileges:
Full user management (add/edit/delete any user)
Delete single or all patient records permanently
Edit all dropdown lists (malignancies, symptoms, etc.)
Configure system settings (make edits to a lot of software functions like drop lists to add and delete and edit its input values , change the bath of app that gets runed by clicking F&N documentation button , delete all local patients records folders and filesâ€¦etc)
Override any clinical warnings/protocols
Edit medication doses
Edit medication maximum doses
Restore from any backup
Export raw statistical data and figures
>Admin Users:
Add/edit patients (no deletion)
Manual data sync
Export data/backups can not restore
View/export statistics
Cannot modify protocols or doses
>Editors:
Add/edit patients
Generate reports
View statistics (no export)
Manual data sync
Access chemo protocols
can change their user password
Cannot modify system configurations
>Pharmacists:
Medication management , edit and change drugs dose and max doses
Dosage calculations 
Chemo stock management
Cannot modify patient demographics cant add, edit or delete
Cant view statistics
Can change their user passwords
>Viewers (Nurses):
Read-only access cant view statistics, chemo sheets or stocks
No export/print capabilities
Cannot change passwords
Cant calculate
Only can access search patients and chemo protocols 

Implementation Approach:
Create a privilege matrix JSON file defining exact permissions
Implement decorator pattern for privilege checks
Store last-modified-by info for all sensitive operations
Password policy: 12+ chars, special chars, 90-day expiration
B. Audit Logging
Log all privileged actions (user, timestamp, action)
Store logs both locally and in Firebase
Make logs viewable only by super admin
2.	Clinical Workflow Enhancements A. Medication Management System
